# Ways to Contribute
There are a number of ways that you can contribute to this project, including,
but not limited to, discussing a post, suggesting a post topic, reporting
errors, and suggesting general improvements to the site.

## Discuss a Post
The simplest and perhaps best way to contribute is to discuss a post. Post
discussions are done through GitHub Issues. Simply click the link at the bottom
of a post to start a new discussion. This should automatically open the new
issue page with an appropriate title filled out. Alternatively, you can simpy
create a new issue using the title format:
> Discussion: &lt;[url-slug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_URL#Slug)&gt;[ - Optional description]

For example:
* Discussion: example-post
* Discussion: example-post - Great post!
* Discussion: example-post - I don't agree with the conclusion

However, be sure to check for
[existing discussions](https://github.com/ttaomae/ttaomae.github.io/labels/Type%3A%20Discussion)
first.

## Report an Error or Suggest an Improvement...
### For a Post
If you find an error in a post or want to suggest an improvement, use the link
at the bottom of the post or create an issue using the title format:
> &lt;[url-slug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_URL#Slug)&gt; - [Description]

For example:
* example-post - Multiple spelling and grammar errors
* exmaple-post - X in second paragraph is unclear
* exmaple-post - Suggestion: Add section about Y and compare with Z

### For Site Design/Layout and Other Content
If you find a problem or want to make a suggestion regarding the site design or
any other content, create a new issue with any descriptive title. For example:
* Site footer does not display properly on X browser
* Heading font sizes are too small

## Suggest a Post Topic
If you have an idea for a topic you would like me to cover in a future post,
create an issue using the title format:
> Post Suggestion - [Your suggestion]

For example:
* Post Suggestion - Builder pattern
* Post Suggestion - Java test framework comparison



# Guidelines for...
## Submitting an Issue
Before submitting an issue (or starting a discussion), be sure to search for
existing issues. Use a descriptive title with an appropriate format, if
applicable (see above). In the body of the issue, include a detailed description
of the issue (or suggestion). Suggestions for how to fix or improve the issue
are appreciated.

If you are reporting an issue related to the site design or layout, include, at
a minimum, the name and version of the browser that you are using. Other
information such as the operating system, device, or screen resolution
(particularly for mobile devices) may also helpful. If possible, please also
attach a screenshot demonstrating the issue.

## Submitting a Pull Request
While I appreciate anyone who wants to help improve this site, I will **not**
accept pull requests which change the content of posts. While I do hope that
others will read and perhaps learn from my posts, this project is also largely
intended to help improve my computer science, software engineering, and writing
skills. As such, I intend for the content of the posts to be a product of my own
research and writing.

This restriction does not include minor issues such as typos, spelling or
grammar errors, or formatting and markdown errors. It also does not apply to
other parts of the site such as headers and footers, the post listing, or the
site design and layout.
