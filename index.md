I am a software developer, currently working for the Hawaii State Archives. I
am part of a small team developing the State's Digital Archives system.

I received my Bachelor of Science (December 2012) and my Master of Science
(December 2015) in [Computer Science](http://www.ics.hawaii.edu) from the
[University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa](http://manoa.hawaii.edu). During my time as a
graduate student, I worked for 4 semesters as a teaching assistant for a variety
of courses [^ta] and one semester as a research assistant [^ra].

[^ta]:
    * Introduction to Computer Science I
    * Introduction to Computer Science II (Data Structures)
    * Operating Systems
    * Logic Design & Microprocessors

[^ra]:
    As a research assistant I investigated data analytics as a method for solar
    irradiance forecasting. Although I was only a research assistant for one
    semester, my research took place over the course of multiple semesters as
    part of my final project and report of my Masters degree.
